Module: genetic_heuristic.py
Paradigm: Evolutionary Computing & Real-Valued Heuristic Search

Description:
    This agent implements an evolutionary approach to determine the optimal scalar weights 
    for evaluating immediate game states. Instead of relying on manually hand-tuned constants, 
    the agent models game strategies (e.g., banner acquisition velocity, tactical blocking, 
    house rarity, and board flexibility) as an artificial chromosome. This chromosome undergoes 
    stochastic evaluation to maximize immediate state transitions.

Research Significance:
    Demonstrates the application of parameter optimization over non-linear game heuristic 
    spaces. Serves as the evolutionary baseline for comparing static weight vectors against 
    iterative reinforcement learning agents.
